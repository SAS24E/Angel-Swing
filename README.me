# Golf Ball Detector

A Python-based golf ball detection system that uses machine learning and OpenCV. This project leverages a custom-trained image classifier to identify golf balls in webcam footage. It's designed as a foundational tool for golf swing analyzers, simulators, and training aids.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 **Real-Time Golf Ball Detection** via webcam  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Integration** for improved detection accuracy  
- 🧠 **Custom Trained Model** using texture- and contour-based features (e.g., dimples)  
- 🛠️ Adjustable pre-processing and post-processing filters (HSV, blur, thresholds, etc.)

## 🧠 Model Info

- Format: TensorFlow/Keras model (`.h5`)  
- Trained on: Custom image dataset (positive: golf balls, negative: background)  
- Accuracy: ~81% on validation set  
- Goal: Enhance precision and reduce false positives in dynamic outdoor environments

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or Keras

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow
```

├── model.h5               # Trained ML model
├── train_model.py         # Script for training the classifier
├── dataset/               # Folder containing labeled training data

```

## ▶️ Usage

Run the main detector:

```bash
python ball_detector.py
```

Or retrain the model (if you’ve updated the dataset):

```bash
python train_model.py
```

## 🔬 Training Data

To retrain, place your labeled images in:

```
dataset/
├── ball/         # Positive samples (images with golf balls)
└── background/   # Negative samples (no golf balls)
```

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Integrate YOLO or MobileNet for advanced object detection  
- Connect with a full swing analyzer pipeline  
- Add live confidence display and bounding box overlays
